Written Report
Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
Based on the data provided, we can conclude that:
•	Over half of all campaigns (56.5%) are successful. The theater category has the greatest number of campaigns at 344, but it is the campaigns in the journalism categories that are most successful. Out of the 4 audio campaigns in the data, all four were successful with a 100% success rate. 
•	Looking at the subcategories, audio journalism and world music were the most successful with a 100% success rate.
•	 Plays are the most numerous campaigns regardless of country.

What are some limitations of this database?
One of the major limitations of this database is that the data provided only gives us the result of the campaign but does not consider what led to these results. Factors that can influence the result of a campaign include the level of marketing the campaign to gain interested donors, prior research on viability of campaign and similarity of other campaigns already in progress.
Another limitation of this database is that the data is not very current. The data only goes up to early 2020 and does not provide an accurate view of how campaigns will perform today.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we can create, and what additional value would they provide?
Some additional tables and graphs we could create to provide a more comprehensive picture of the data are:
•	Percent of successful and successful campaigns based on parent and sub-categories. This will tell us which types of campaigns are more likely to be successful in the future.
•	It would be interesting to see a graph that displays the success of campaigns by the length of time the campaigns are open.
•	A way to evaluate the goal setting strategy would also be insightful. This could tell future campaigns if it is better to set a lower goal so that your campaign is more likely to be successful.
Statistical Analysis
Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
I believe that the median better summarizes the data than the mean. There are many campaigns that have a low number of backers, and the mean is skewed higher by the campaigns that have a high number of backers. The median will look at the number that lies at the midpoint of our data set.

Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
There is more variability with successful campaigns than with unsuccessful campaigns. I believe that this makes sense because when you look at the number of successful campaigns based on goals, a greater percentage of the successful campaigns are in the lower goal ranges than the failed campaigns. By having a lower goal to reach the successful campaigns will need less backers. Unsuccessful campaign either have a very low number of backers or there are not enough backers to reach the funding goal.
